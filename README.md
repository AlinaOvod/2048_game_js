# Game 2048 on JS
## 1. A Brief Description of the Project
This project is a web-based implementation of the popular puzzle game "2048." The game consists of a 4x4 grid where players combine tiles of the same number to form larger numbers, ultimately aiming to create a tile with the number 2048. The game provides a user interface for starting and restarting the game, displays the current score, and shows messages based on the game state (e.g., win, lose, start, restart). The game is controlled using keyboard arrow keys to move tiles in different directions (up, down, left, right).

## 2. Technologies that to have been used:
- HTML: Used for structuring the content of web pages.
- SCSS (Sass): A CSS preprocessor used to streamline CSS development with variables, mixins, and nesting.
- JavaScript (ES6+ and Modules):
  - Classes: Used to encapsulate game logic in classes like Grid, Cell, and Tile.
  - Modules: Code is modularized using import and export statements.
  - Event Handling: keydown event listener for capturing arrow key inputs.
  - DOM Manipulation: Creating and manipulating DOM elements dynamically (e.g., creating tiles, updating score).
    
The project combines modern web development practices using HTML5, SCSS, and JavaScript ES6 modules to create a fully functional and interactive 2048 game. The game logic is encapsulated in JavaScript classes, and the UI is dynamically updated based on user interactions. The use of SCSS allows for a clean and maintainable styling approach, while the modular JavaScript code ensures scalability and reusability.
